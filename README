This is an adaptation of AWS SDK for use on Google AppEngine.

Changes made here allow user to provide own HTTP Client Factory implementation. 

An extended HTTP Client Factory class (not included in this library) provides 
an implementation of HTTPClient that sends requests using GAE's URL Fetch service. 

P.S. I tested this only for the SES service for now. In fact, before the build 
I deleted locally all other packages I didn't need, which resulted in 10x smaller
jar file.
